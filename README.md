# Product Details Exporter Chrome Extension

## Overview

The **Product Details Exporter** is a Chrome extension designed to extract product information from fashion e-commerce websites like Croma. The extension retrieves essential product details such as name, price, and image URL and allows users to export this information in a CSV format for easy access and manipulation.

## Features

- Extracts product name, price, and image URL.
- Displays extracted details in a modern, user-friendly popup interface.
- Exports product details as a CSV file.
- Responsive design with a 3D card effect for better user experience.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhinash04/product_extractor.git


**Load the extension in Chrome:**

Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
Enable Developer mode using the toggle in the top right corner.
Click on Load unpacked and select the extension's directory.

**Usage**

Visit a product page on a supported fashion e-commerce website (e.g., Croma).
Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
The popup will display the product details fetched from the page.
Click the Export as CSV button to download the product details.

**Note**

The extension may not fetch the prodtuct details at the first time so the user need to refresh the browser for once so that the extension will be able to fetch the product details. With further improvements we will try to increase the scalabilty of this extension using API. For now the user can see the product details available on croma.
